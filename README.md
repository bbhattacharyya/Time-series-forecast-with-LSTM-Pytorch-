# Multivariate Time-series-forecast-with-LSTM-Pytorch
This code is getting improved, and intension is to try and test few other modules for predicting future outcomes. Besides, want to try Gabor transformation to make the module learn the data for future predictions. The data is found at UCI database, freely available to download. This data is a time-series recording of infection of 20 cities across Hungary around the year 2005. Data were recorded at every 20 days. In this code, we use data obtained from only two cities. So we are working on multivariate data in this case.
